# Developer Onboarding: Understanding the Vision

*Getting aligned on why Cosmos exists and what we're building*

---

## Welcome to Cosmos

Before diving into code, it's important to understand the *why* behind what we're building. Cosmos isn't just another job search tool—it's designed to fundamentally change how job seekers experience the search process.

This document will help you get up to speed on the vision, methodology, and philosophy that drives our product decisions.

## Step 1: Get Access to the Product Repo & Read the Foundation

**Action**: Get added to the `cosmos-pm` repo (product documentation)

> **Note**: The `cosmos-pm` repo is private. To request access, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nuj6GrVt) and share your GitHub username in the #dev-onboarding channel. If the Discord invite has expired, open an issue on GitHub requesting access.

The `cosmos-pm` repo contains our product strategy and vision documents. Start with the foundation documents in this order:

1. **01-cosmos-vision.md** — The soul of Cosmos. Why we exist and what we believe about job searching.

2. **02-cosmos-strategy.md** — How we plan to win. Our strategic pillars and key bets.

3. **03-cosmos-opportunities.md** — The problem space we're solving.

4. **04-cosmos-mvp-plan.md** — What we're building right now.

**Key takeaway**: Cosmos makes targeted outreach feel as satisfying as spray-and-pray, while being far more effective. We're the Duolingo of job search.

## Step 2: Watch the Demo Videos

**Action**: Watch the Cosmos demo videos

These will give you a feel for the product experience we're creating—the Cosmos metaphor, the UI, and how users interact with the system.

## Step 3: Read "Never Search Alone"

**Action**: Read [Never Search Alone](https://www.neversearchalone.com/) by Phyl Terry

This book is foundational to understanding our target users. Key concepts:

- **Job Search Council (JSC)** — A peer support group for job seekers
- **Candidate-Market Fit (CMF)** — Finding the intersection of what you want and what the market wants
- **The emotional journey** — Job searching is brutal; community helps

**Bonus**: If you're currently searching for a job (or might be in the future), consider joining a JSC yourself. It's a great way to experience what our users go through.

## Step 4: Read "The 2-Hour Job Search"

**Action**: Read [The 2-Hour Job Search](https://2hourjobsearch.com/) by Steve Dalton

This is the tactical playbook that many of our users follow. Key concepts:

- **LAMP list** — Prioritizing target companies systematically
- **Why networking beats applications** — 80% of jobs are filled through networking
- **The Naturalize → Convince → Reach Out framework**

Understanding 2HJS helps you understand the workflows Cosmos is designed to support.

## Why This Matters for Development

When you understand the methodology and the emotional journey, you'll make better product decisions:

- **Why we celebrate pipeline progress, not just applications** — Because relationships > volume
- **Why the UI should feel calming** — Because job search is already stressful enough
- **Why we're not building a job board** — Because that adds to the noise, not cuts through it
- **Why personalization matters** — Because "spray and pray" is the failure mode we're fighting against

Every feature you build should ask: *Does this make targeted outreach easier and more satisfying?*

---

## Questions to Discuss

After completing this onboarding:

1. What's your own experience with job searching? (Good or bad, it helps us empathize)
2. What surprised you about the NSA or 2HJS approach?
3. What aspects of Cosmos excite you most?
