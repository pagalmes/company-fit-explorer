Career Goals - Short-term
Seeking Senior/Principal/Staff level roles in Product security to lead application/product security functions which have a strong balance of security assessment, R&D, and tool development work.I have experience performing security assessments across multiple application/infrastructure stacks, developing complex solutions for common security problems, M&A work, have worked in highly regulated environment (CME Group) and consulting (specifically for application security and infrastructure work). I am considering startups in late funding rounds and public companies. My target compensation is 400-500k.

I’m looking for a company culture where the product sells itself, the people I work with are invested in technical expertise, and intrinsically are interested in complex technical matters. I want to work with other people who are self-starters and are dedicated to a philosophy of life-long learning. I want my colleagues and myself to enjoy working and genuinely have fun. I don’t mind working from an office but I have to be bought in on the company and the coworkers I surround myself with.
