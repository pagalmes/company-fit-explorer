## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd company-fit-explorer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up Supabase Database (Optional but Recommended)**

For full functionality with user data persistence:

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials
# Get these from your Supabase project dashboard → Settings → API
```

Then run the automated setup:
```bash
npm run setup:supabase
```

**📖 Detailed Setup Guide**: See [docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md](docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md) for complete instructions.

**⚡ Skip Database Setup**: The app works perfectly without Supabase - it will use default company data and localStorage for persistence.

4. Start the development server:

**Option A: Full Development Experience (Recommended)**
```bash
npm run dev:full
```
This runs all three servers with color-coded output:
- 🔵 **React app** (port 5173-5174) - Main application interface
- 🟢 **File server** (port 3001) - Automatic companies.ts persistence  
- 🟡 **LLM server** (port 3002) - AI functionality and company analysis

**Option B: React App Only**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Basic development without automatic file persistence.

### 🌟 First-Time Experience

For new users, the app shows a magical "Dreamy First Contact" onboarding flow:
1. **Cosmic Welcome**: Animated spark with floating stars
2. **Universe Awakening**: Explosion transition animation  
3. **File Upload**: Upload resume and career fit document
4. **Profile Processing**: Files are processed to customize your CMF profile
5. **Universe Generation**: Cosmic loading screen before launching into the main app

**Test URLs:**
- First-time experience: `http://localhost:3000/` 
- Skip intro (for testing): `http://localhost:3000/?skip-intro=true`
- Reset experience: Clear localStorage and revisit

**File Processing:**
- Uploaded files are analyzed to extract skills, experience, preferences
- Creates personalized CMF profile based on your documents
- Fallback to default profile if processing fails

**Option C: Individual Servers**
```bash
# Individual server commands
npm run dev              # React app only
npm run dev:file-server  # File server only  
npm run dev:llm-server   # LLM API server only

# Manual multi-terminal setup
# Terminal 1: React app
npm run dev
# Terminal 2: File server
npm run dev:file-server  
# Terminal 3: LLM server
npm run dev:llm-server
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in the console)

### 💾 Development Persistence

When using `npm run dev:full` or running servers manually:
- **Added companies** are automatically saved to `companies.ts`
- **Watchlist changes** persist across browser refreshes
- **Removed companies** are tracked and can be restored
- **View mode preferences** are maintained
- **LLM functionality** is available for company analysis and testing

Without the LLM server, AI features like "Test Backend Connection" and company analysis won't work.
Without the file server, changes are only saved to localStorage and won't persist across file edits.

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development

This project uses comprehensive **multi-layer testing** with **206 unit tests + 6 E2E visual tests** covering all core functionality including **edge highlighting regression protection** and **watchlist functionality**, ensuring reliability and preventing regressions across visual interactions.

### Quick Test Commands
```bash
# Unit Tests
npm test              # Watch mode for development
npm run test:run      # CI mode (run once)  
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
npm run test:ui       # Visual test runner interface

# E2E Visual Tests  
npm run test:e2e      # Screenshot-based visual regression tests
npm run test:e2e:ui   # Interactive E2E test runner  
npx playwright show-report tests/reports # View test results and screenshots
```

## 📊 Data Structure

The application uses a comprehensive persistent state system for exploration data:

```typescript
interface UserExplorationState {
  id: string;                          // User identifier
  name: string;                        // User display name
  cmf: UserCMF;                        // Complete CMF profile
  baseCompanies: Company[];            // Original dataset companies
  addedCompanies: Company[];           // User-added companies with LLM analysis
  removedCompanyIds: number[];         // IDs of companies removed by user
  watchlistCompanyIds: number[];       // IDs of companies saved to watchlist
  lastSelectedCompanyId?: number;      // Last selected company for restoration
  viewMode: ViewMode;                  // Current view: 'explore' or 'watchlist'
}

interface UserCMF {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  mustHaves: string[];        // Critical requirements
  wantToHave: string[];       // Nice-to-have preferences  
  experience: string[];       // Relevant experience areas
  targetRole: string;         // Desired position level
  targetCompanies: string;    // Company stage preference
}

interface Company {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  logo: string;               // Company logo URL
  careerUrl: string;          // Careers page URL for applications
  matchScore: number;         // CMF match percentage (0-100)
  industry: string;           // Company industry
  stage: string;              // Funding/company stage
  location: string;           // Primary location
  employees: string;          // Team size range
  remote: string;             // Remote work policy
  openRoles: number;          // Available positions
  connections: number[];      // Connected company IDs
  connectionTypes: Record<number, string>; // Relationship types
  matchReasons: string[];     // Why this company matches your CMF
  color: string;              // Node color based on match quality
  angle?: number;             // Position angle around CMF center
  distance?: number;          // Distance from center based on match score
}
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Updating Your CMF Profile

Edit the user profile in `src/data/companies.ts`. The system now uses complete `UserExplorationState` objects:

```typescript
const yourProfile: UserExplorationState = {
  id: "your-id",
  name: "Your Name",
  cmf: {
    id: "your-id",
    name: "Your Name", 
    mustHaves: [
      "Your critical requirements",
      "Non-negotiable needs"
    ],
    wantToHave: [
      "Nice-to-have preferences",
      "Additional interests"
    ],
    experience: ["Your experience areas"],
    targetRole: "Your desired role level",
    targetCompanies: "Your company stage preference"
  },
  baseCompanies: baseCompanies,    // Reference to main dataset
  addedCompanies: [],              // Your custom companies
  removedCompanyIds: [],           // Companies you've removed
  watchlistCompanyIds: [],         // Your saved companies
  lastSelectedCompanyId: undefined,
  viewMode: 'explore'
};

// Switch active user by changing this line:
export const activeUserProfile = yourProfile;
```

### Adding New Companies

**Option 1: Use the UI (Recommended)**
- Click the "+" button in the application
- Enter company name and let the LLM analyze it against your CMF
- Companies are automatically added to your `addedCompanies` array
- In development mode, changes are saved to `companies.ts` automatically

**Option 2: Manual Addition**
Add companies to the `baseCompanies` array in `src/data/companies.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: 20, // Use next available ID
  name: "New Company",
  logo: "https://logo.clearbit.com/company.com",
  careerUrl: "https://company.com/careers",
  matchScore: 85,
  industry: "Industry",
  stage: "Company Stage", 
  location: "Location",
  employees: "Team Size",
  remote: "Remote Policy",
  openRoles: 5,
  connections: [1, 3], // IDs of connected companies
  connectionTypes: { 1: "Competitor", 3: "Partner" },
  matchReasons: ["Reason why it matches your CMF"],
  color: "#F59E0B", // Color based on match score (auto-calculated)
  angle: 45,        // Position angle around center (auto-calculated)
  distance: 100     // Distance from center (auto-calculated)
}
```

### Customizing Match Score Calculation

Match scores can be enhanced to be dynamic based on:
- Alignment with your must-have requirements
- Geographic location preferences  
- Company culture and values fit
- Role level and compensation expectations
- Industry and technical focus areas

### Using the Watchlist Feature

**Save Companies to Your Watchlist:**
- Click any company node to view details in the sidebar
- Click "Save to Watchlist" button with the heart icon
- The button color changes to red when a company is saved

**Switch Between Views:**
- Use the toggle buttons at the top: "Explore Companies (15)" or "Watchlist (X)"
- Explore mode shows all companies in the dataset
- Watchlist mode filters to show only your saved companies

**Track Your Progress:**
- View watchlist statistics in the sidebar (total companies, excellent matches, open roles)
- Heart indicators appear on company logos in the sidebar for saved companies
- Data persists across browser sessions using localStorage

### Company Management

**Remove Companies:**
- Click any company to view details in the sidebar
- Click the "Remove Company" button at the bottom
- Confirm removal in the modal dialog
- Removed companies are hidden from both explore and watchlist views

**Restore Companies:**
- Use the "+" button to add a company
- If you try to add a previously removed company, it will be automatically restored
- No LLM analysis is needed for restored companies (improves performance)

**Persistent Storage:**
- All removal/restore actions are saved across browser sessions
- Removed companies remain hidden until explicitly restored
- Data is synchronized across multiple browser tabs

### CMF Panel Customization

**Collapse/Expand the CMF Panel:**
- Click anywhere on the CMF panel header to toggle
- Use keyboard shortcuts: Enter, Space (expand/collapse), Escape (collapse only)
- Your preference is automatically saved for future visits
- Provides more screen space for graph visualization when collapsed

### Styling Customization

The application uses Tailwind CSS. Key styling areas:
- `src/styles/index.css` - Global styles and Tailwind imports
- Component classes in the TSX files for layout and colors
- Cytoscape styles in `src/utils/graphDataTransform.ts` for graph visualization

## 🔄 Company Connections

## 🤝 Contributing

We use **Test-Driven Development** to ensure code quality. Please follow these guidelines:

### Before Making Changes
1. **Run existing tests**: `npm test`
2. **Ensure all tests pass** (currently 212 tests across 13 files)
3. **Check coverage doesn't decrease**: `npm run test:coverage`
4. **Run E2E tests**: `npm run test:e2e` (may need visual baseline updates)

### Adding New Features (TDD Approach)
1. **Write test first** describing the expected behavior
2. **Run test** to confirm it fails (red phase)
3. **Implement feature** to make test pass (green phase)
4. **Refactor code** while keeping tests green
5. **Ensure coverage stays above 85%**

### Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. **Write tests for new functionality**
4. Implement features following TDD workflow
5. **Verify all tests pass**: `npm run test:run`
6. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`
7. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
8. Open a Pull Request

### Test Categories to Consider
- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and utilities
- **Component Tests**: UI interactions and rendering  
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end user workflows
- **Data Validation**: Real dataset integrity checks

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Automatic Persistence Not Working

If added companies, watchlist changes, or removals aren't being saved to `companies.ts`:

**Problem**: Development file server isn't running
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Option 1: Use the full development setup
npm run dev:full

# Option 2: Start the file server manually (if React app is already running)
npm run dev:file-server
```

**Verify it's working**:
- Check console for "💾 Automatically saved to companies.ts" messages
- File server should show: "🚀 Development file server running on http://localhost:3001"
- After starting the file server, refresh your browser tab

**Alternative**: If file server isn't working, check the browser console for manual copy/paste instructions

### Performance Issues

**Slow hover/selection**: Check if too many companies are loaded
**Graph rendering issues**: Try refreshing the page or clearing localStorage
**LLM analysis slow**: Company analysis depends on external API response times

### E2E Test Failures

Visual regression tests may fail after UI changes:
```bash
# Update test snapshots after visual improvements
npm run test:e2e -- --update-snapshots
```
