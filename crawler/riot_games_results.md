### Why 60 jobs mention "security"?

Many job descriptions include this boilerplate text about data security requirements:

> "Per the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance, the following core duties may create a basis for disqualifying candidates with relevant criminal histories: **Safeguarding confidential and sensitive Company data**..."

This causes false positives in broad keyword searches.
